Envy24HT
========

OSX driver for several Terratec, M-Audio, ESI, and Audiotrak, and other sound cards based on the Via/ICE Vynil VT172X series of PCI DSP chips. Forked from http://www.audio-evolution.com/drivers/


PPC Macs support
================

This repository contains a fork of the driver made by ITzTravelInTime that supports both intel and ppc macs with all os versions from os x tiger onwards.

Supported sound cards
=====================

Currently supported cards are:
- Terratec Aureon 5.1 Sky   (best support)
- Terratec Aureon 7.1 Space (best support)
- Terratec Phase22          (best support)
- Terratec Phase28          (best support)
- M-Audio Revolution 5.1
- M-Audio Revolution 7.1
- M-Audio Audiophile 192
- ESI Juli@
- ESI Prodigy 7.1 Hi-Fi     (Alpha support partially working)
- ESI MAYA44                (Alpha support partially working)
- Audiotrack Prodigy 7.1    (best support)
- Audiotrack Prodigy HD2
- Infrasonic Quartet        (Pre-Alpha support not working yet)

Other cards featuring the same Envy24HT (or the via VT1724) could work with this driver but it's very likely that those could have issues, missing features or even not working at all, the driver has been tested only with the cards listed above.

Cards that might work (but are currently untested or need implementation work):
- Onkyo SE 90
- Onkyo SE 150
- Onkyo SE 200
- Chinese PCIe cards featuring the VT1721 or VT1723 chips
